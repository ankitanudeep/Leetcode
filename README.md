## How to Start Your LeetCode Preparation

If you're just starting out or planning for interviews, here‚Äôs a practical roadmap to approach problems:

### Step 1: Build Foundations (Easy Level)
Focus on understanding core concepts and solving easy problems.  
Topics to begin with:
- Arrays (sliding window, prefix sum)
- Strings (manipulation, hashing)
- HashMaps & Sets (frequency, lookups)
- Stacks & Queues (basic operations)

**Goal**: Master patterns, not just problems.

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è Step 2: Level Up with Patterns (Medium Level)
Move to slightly challenging problems that involve:
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Binary Trees and BSTs
- Two Pointers & Sorting
- Prefix/Suffix techniques
- Greedy strategies
- Basic DP (like Fibonacci, 0/1 Knapsack)

**Goal**: Identify repeated problem-solving patterns.

---

### Step 3: Master the Tough Ones (Hard Level)
Focus on problems requiring deeper understanding:
- Advanced DP (palindromes, intervals)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)
- Union-Find, Tries
- Segment Trees, Monotonic Stacks
- Bit Manipulation

**Goal**: Simulate interview pressure, write optimized code.

## Tips for Consistent Progress
- Set a daily goal (1-3 problems)
- Review previous mistakes regularly
- Write down brute-force before optimizing
- Focus on learning, not just solving
- Revisit tough problems after a few days
